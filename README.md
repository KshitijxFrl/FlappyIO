# Flappy.io

Flappy.io is a custom reskin of one of the most popular yet simpile concept which is the flappy concept which many of us known as the flappy bird game but the major feature of the flappyio is that it uses partial reinforcement learning with a integration of custom feed forward neural network and custom learning module by which it learn the game over the multiple generarions and try to achive the highest score.
*  The FlappyIO is created in javascript and it does not use external any machine/deep learning library. 
*  Every module of this project (which include all the modules of the neural network, logic, learning, math, etc) is created from the scratch.
*  The graphical elements such as space ship, background, obstical (pipes) are collected through research from multiple 2d graphical websites and some of them are custom made with the help of the photo shop.
*  As there is no deicated 2/3d engine in vanila javascript the main.js is solving that problem by becoming a engine, which responsible for the actual mutal progression of the logical and graphical modules.
*  For the front end it use a basic html and css page which allows user to enter some parmeters to observe the various chages happen in the simulator and the front end page is very strong and capabel enough to handel all of the heavy animations with smooth operation and processing.
